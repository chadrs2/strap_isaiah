// Babylonia // In the week before the battle of Hattusburg , Rabshakeh had been sent to Jerusalem by the Assyrian king Hezek
He stood by the conduit in Fuller's Highway , looking for the prisoner .
And then Eliakim , Hilkiah's son , and Shebna , Asaph's son , the scribe .
Rabshakeh , the great king of Assyria , said , " What confidence is this ? "
I have a plan and strength for war: who do you trust ?
Thus , if a man's weakness is such that his bonds can be grabbed , and that he has penetrated with his staff , which is the king of Egypt , his power over him is already well established .
If you say we trust in the Lord , is it not the one who took the high places and the altars , and said to Judah and Jerusalem , you shall be worshipped ?
I'll give you two thousand horses if you can manage to ride them .
And why , then , trust chariots and horses with Egypt ?
And now , in the name of the Lord , I am going to destroy this country ?
The Lord said , Go to the land and destroy it .
And so , to be a little better informed of what it is that you have to say , we need to go to Damascus , for we understand it

Rabshakeh's words were heard in the Jewish language , and made the mighty king of Assyria cry out in his tears .
So the king says , not let Hezekiah deceive you: he can't do it .
You will not be given this city , the Lord will surely deliver us from you , " the thief said .
Thus say the king of Assyria , and he comes to me with a present , and he eats all of his fruits and all of his figs .
Watch out , hezekiah will convince you that the Lord will deliver us .
Did the king of Assyria give his lands to the Gods of the nations ?
Where's the god of Hamath and Arphad , or Thar ?
( To Remzi ) Where's that Sepharvaim god of yours ?
And were they giving Samaria to me ? "
Whose god of the land delivered his nation to my hand , and with the plenitude of the Lord came Jerusalem to be with me ?
He made his reply , but they did not answer him , for the king's commandment was , " Answer him . "
And when you had a son , and you were getting ready to give him to the One who lives in your heart , and you say to him ,' It is not for you to know; but for the dead ,' and there was a great

Thus Isaiah the servant of King Hezekiah came to be with them .
Thus say the Lord , Be not afraid of the words you heard , where the king of Assyria has come to me to mock me .

Rabshakeh returned , and found a pair of Assyrian kings fighting with the Assyrian king Libnah .
He heard that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia is coming to fight you .
And when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying , Jerusalem will not be deceived , saying , Jerusalem will not be destroyed .
Oh , you heard what the Assyrians did to all the land , and you are set free ?
Like Gozan , Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden who went into Telassar , did the gods of the nations deliver them ?
Where is the king of Hamath , the king of Arphad , the king of Sepharvaim , the king of the city ?
But the messengers of the Lord , who had given him the letter , took it from his hand and read it: and Hezekiah read it to the HEAD OF THE EYE and in the congregation .

I did so to destroy the cities of ruinous ruin .
Small and confused , they had come in through the fields , as the grass of the field , as the turf on the roof , and as corn was blown away .
I know your house , and your way out , and your anger against me , and your problems .
I'll line my hook up your nose , and I'll pull you out of your mouth , and turn you around by the way you came in .

When he worshipped Nisroch , his god , Adrammelech and Sharezer's sons smote him with the sword; and they fled to the land of Armenia .
In those days , he was ill with the sickness of Hezekiah .
He was called Isaiah the prophet of Amoz , " he said .
And you know , O LORD , how I have sinned , and in the name of the glory of God , I have done unto you with a perfect heart and I have sinned against you with such unblinking
And Hezekiah was crying , too .
( Isaiah , the Lord , the God of David , I heard your prayer , I saw your tears .
I'll take you and the city of Assyria from the hand of King Agora . "

Our Lord will sing our songs to the instruments of his kingdom all our days in the house of the LORD .
And Isaiah said , Take a lump of figs and place it on the boil , and it will be well .
What sign is this I am set to go into the house of the Lord ?
Hezekiah had been sent a letter and a present from the king of Babylon , Baladan , who had heard he was ill .
She showed them the gem of the house of the precious things , silver , gold , ointment , and everything in the house of armor , and of the bloody skull of the gold , and of the hand and arm and legs and teeth , and
Then Hezekiah the king asked , What did these people say ?
And who came into you from where you were ? "
They came from a distant land to me , even from Babylon .
Then he said , What did they see in your house ? '
I have seen all this in my house , hezekiah replied , there is nothing in my treasure that I have not shown them .
( Isaiah to Hezekiah , hear the word of the LORD: Behold , the days are coming , and all the glory of your house and father's house shall be taken away from you .
They will take away from you your sons , who are to be born in you , and make them eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . "

He is a tender plant , and as a root out of dry earth , his flowers are not lovely .
He hated and rejected men , and was notorious for the sorrowful , almost sad , solitude he preferred to his office .
We were saddened , mourned , moved to the edge of tears , moving toward a state of bliss .

He was put away from prison and from the courts: Who can tell a generation ?
He has been displaced from the land of the living: He was a transgression of my people .

And he will see the sufferings of his soul , and he will be satisfied: he will bear the sins of my soul .
Because of the force of his soul pouring out into death , he divided the spoils with the strong .
You , who did not bear , who did not suffer , who did not suffer , who did not suffer , who did not give; who , through all this , did not suffer .
He has found that tents , curtains , corduroy , stakes , pulleys , and the like , have been tested , and all have failed to hold up against an assault .
