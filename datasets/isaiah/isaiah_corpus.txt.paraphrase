in the fourth year of Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria was attacked by all the cities of Judah, and he took them.
Rabshakeh was sent to Jerusalem by the Assyrian king Hezekiah with a large army.
in the highway of the fuller's field, he stood by the conduit.
then Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in the house, and Shebna, Asaph's son, the scribe.
"what confidence is this?" Said Rabshakeh, the great king of Assyria.
I'm telling you, I have a plan and strength for war: who do you trust?
so, if a man is weak, he will be able to grab him, and he will be able to penetrate him with his staff, which is the king of Egypt.
if you say we trust the Lord, is it not the one who took the high places and the altars of the Lord, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, you will be worshiped?
if you can, I'll give you two thousand horses if you're able to take them.
then why do you trust Egypt's chariots and horses to the Egyptians?
and now I'm going to destroy this country without the Lord?
the Lord said, Go to the land and destroy it.
for we understand it: and speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it:
but did your master send me to your master and to you to tell you this?
he didn't send me to the men who sit on the wall, so they could eat their dung and drink their piss with you?
Rabshakeh cried loudly in the Jewish language, and the great king of Assyria's words were heard.
so the king says, don't let Hezekiah deceive you: He can't do it.
the Lord will not give you the city, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us.
so say the king of Assyria, and he will come to me with a present, and he will eat all of his fruit and all of his figs.
watch out, hezekiah will convince you that the Lord will deliver us.
did the king of Assyria give his land to the gods of the nations?
where's the god of Hamath and Arphad?
where's the Sepharvaim god?
and did they give Samaria to me?
who among the gods of the land have delivered the land to my hand, and the Lord has delivered Jerusalem to my hand?
they answered him, but they did not answer him, for the king's commandment was, "Answer him."
shebna, the scribe, Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, and Shebna, the son of Sheba, the scribe, and Shebna, the son of Sheba, the scribe, and
when Hezekiah heard it, he took off his clothes and covered himself with a sackcloth and went to the house of the Lord.
Isaiah the prophet of Amoz, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests were covered with a blanket.
so he said, this day is a day of trouble, and a warning, and a blasphemy: for the children are born, and there's no strength to bring them.
the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, the king of Assyria's master, and will punish the words of the Lord your God:
so the king Hezekiah's servants came to Isaiah.
so say the Lord, Be not afraid of the words you heard, where the king of Assyria has offended me.
look, I'll send a blast, and he'll hear the rumour, and he'll come back to his own country.
Rabshakeh returned, and he found the Assyrian king Libnah fighting with the Assyrian king.
he heard that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia was coming to fight you.
when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, Jerusalem will not deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be destroyed.
oh, you heard what the Assyrians have done to all the land, and you're supposed to be released?
as Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar, did the gods of the nations deliver them?
where's the king of Hamath, the king of Arphad, the king of Sepharvaim, the king of the city?
the messenger of the Lord, who had sent the letter, took the letter from his hand and read it: and Hezekiah was reading it to the LORD.
the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, the one who dwells between the cherubs, is God, the only one of all the kingdoms of the world.
open your eyes, O LORD, and see, O LORD, and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to shame the living God.
for the Assyrians, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all nations, and their countries, and the gods they were made of wood and stone: therefore, they were not gods, but men's hands.
so, O Lord, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the world know you're the Lord.
thus saith the LORD God of Israel, And thou didst pray to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
who did you blame and offend?
and who raised your voice and looked up at the sky?
even against the Holy One of the Jewish people.
I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm going to the mountains, I'm
I've been digging, drinking water, and I've been drying up the entire river.
did you hear how I've done it, and how I've done it?
I've done it so that you destroy the cities of ruinous ruins.
they were small, and they were confused, as the grass of the field, as the grass on the roof, and as corn was blown away.
I know your house, and your way out, and your anger against me.
I'll put my hook in your nose, and I'll pull you out of your mouth, and I'll turn you around by the way you came.
this year, as well as the next year, you will be eating what grows, and the next year, the same as the first year.
the remnant of the house of Judah will be taken down, and the remnant will be lifted up, and the fruit will be upward:
so the Assyrian king will not come to the city, nor will he shoot an arrow, nor will he be able to defend himself.
by the way, the same thing will happen to him, and he won't come back, and he won't come to the city.
I'll defend the city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.
the angel of the Lord came, and he struck the Assyrian camp with a hundred and four hundred and five thousand: and when they came to the morning, they were dead.
Sennacherib's king of Assyria has left, and he's gone and returned.
when he was worshipping Nisroch, his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer's sons struck him with the sword; and they fled to the land of Armenia.
he was sick of Hezekiah in those days.
Isaiah the prophet Amoz came to him, and said,
remember, O LORD, I beg you, how I've done it, and I've done it with a perfect heart and I've done it with a perfect heart.
and Hezekiah was crying.
Isaiah, the Lord, the God of David, I heard your prayer, I've seen your tears.
I'll take you and the city of Assyria from the king of Assyria's hand.
it's a sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do what he has said, and the sun will be gone, and the sun will be gone, and the sun will be gone.
by the tenth degree, the sun was back.
when he was sick, and he recovered from his disease, I said I'd go to the grave: I'm sick of the rest of the time.
I'm not going to see the Lord in the world, even the Lord.
I'm leaving the shepherd's tent, and I'm leaving my life as a weaver: He'll cut me off with a sickening disease.
I've been thinking about it, as a lion, so I'm thinking of it, so I'm thinking of it, so I'm thinking of it, so I'm thinking of it
as a crane or a swallow, I'm like a dove: I'm looking up, and I'm afraid of my eyes.
what do you want to tell me?
he's spoken to me, and he's done it himself.
oh, my God, for the life of my soul, and for all the things that live, my soul is alive.
oh, my soul, I was bitter, but you gave me a great bitterness for peace: but you've taken my soul from the pit of corruption.
death cannot praise you, death can't celebrate you.
as I do today, the father of the children will tell you the truth: The living, the living, he will praise you.
we will sing our songs to the instruments of the LORD all our lives in the house of the LORD.
Isaiah said, Let's take a lump of figs and put it on the boil, and he'll be fine.
what's the sign I'm going to the house of the Lord?
hezekiah was sent a letter and a present from the king of Babylon, Baladan, who had heard he was sick.
she showed them the house of the precious things, the silver, the gold, the precious ointment, and everything in the house of the armor, and everything in the house of the armor.
then Hezekiah the king asked, What did these people say?
and who came to you from where?
they came from a distant country to me, even from Babylon.
then he said, what did they see in your house?
hezekiah answered, I've seen everything in my house: There's nothing in my treasure that I didn't show them.
Isaiah to Hezekiah, hear the word of the LORD: Behold, the days are coming, and everything in your house and your father's house will be taken away.
they will take your sons, who will be born in you, and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Isaiah answered, Good is the word of God, which you have spoken.
in my time, there will be peace and truth.

all right, let's get together, and listen to what they've said?
the Lord loves him, and he will be happy to do Babylon's arm.
I've spoken, even I, I've spoken, and he's done well.
I didn't tell you from the beginning, from the time I started, I'm here, and the Lord God and his spirit sent me.
so the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, I am the God of your salvation, which leads you to the way you should go.
you should have listened to my instructions!
he was like a river, and his name was like the waves of the sea.

the evil is not peace, the Lord says.
listen, O isles, for me, and hearken, you people, from the depths of my mother's womb, he's calling me.
he hid me in the shadow of his hand, and I was a polished spear; in his holster he hid me; And said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel.
I've been working, I've wasted my strength, I've wasted my strength, and I've wasted my strength.
the LORD has created me from the womb to serve him, and I will be strong in the eyes of the LORD, and my God will be my strength.
I will also give you a light for the gentiles, that you may be a light for the Jews, that you may be a light for the Jews:
the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, the Holy One of God, to whom the nation is abhorrent, to the servant of the king, the king will be pleased.
the LORD, I heard you, and I've helped you, and I'll keep you, and I'll help you in the day of salvation.

look, these are from the north and from the west; and these are from the land of Sinim.
sing, O heaven; and be happy, O earth; and sing, O mountains: for the Lord has comforted his people, and he will be pleased with them.
but the Lord has forgotten me, and my Lord has forgotten me.
should a woman forget her son's suckling, that she shouldn't be able to care about her son?
yes, they'll forget, but I won't forget you.
look, I'm on my hands and your walls are constantly before me.
your children will be quick, and your destroyers will be gone.

then you'll tell me who's got me, and if I lost my kids, and I'm lost, and I'm gone?
who's gonna bring them up?
look, I'm alone; where did they go?
the Lord God, I'll lift my hand to the Gentiles, and I'll put my standard on the people.
they will bow to you with their faces to the ground, and lick the dust of your feet.

I will give them to you as sweet wine, and they will drink their blood like sweet wine.
so the Lord says, Where's the divorce of your mother?
or who's the creditor I sold you?
look, you sold your sins, and your mother has been taken away.
so I'm not here, right?
was there no one to answer when I called?
is my hand shortened, so I can't be forgiven?
or can I not do it?
I'm drying the sea, I'm drying the river, and the fish stink.
I'm taking the sky, and I'm covering the blackness.
the Lord God gave me a tongue, so I could speak to him who was tired, and he woke me up in the morning.
the Lord God opened my ears and I didn't resist, but I didn't want to.

who among you is the one who is the Lord, who's listening to the voice of his servant, who's walking in the dark?

look, you who follow the law, you who seek the Lord, look to the rock where you're digging.
look to your father Abraham, and Sarah who gave you birth.
the Lord will comfort Zion, and he will comfort all the waste places, and he will be like the garden of the Lord; joy and joy will be found there.
for the sake of the people, listen to me, my people, and listen to me, my nation.
I'm almost there, my righteousness is almost complete, my salvation is gone, and I'm waiting for them to trust me.
look into the sky, and look down on the earth beneath:

I took the cup of your hand, but not with wine.
come, awake, awake, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for the time is not yet.
get out of the dust, you're going to sit down, you're a captive of the temple, you daughter of Zion.
so the Lord says, you've sold your soul for nothing, and you'll be saved without money.
so the Assyrian was oppressed by the Assyrian, and the Assyrian was oppressed without cause.
so then, what's the point of my people, the Lord?
the Lord says, "They rule over them, and they scream, "My name is still being condemned."
so my name will be known by my people: therefore they will know me.
the feet of the good man who brings good news, that he brings good news to the mountains, that he brings good news to the mountains; that he says to the mountains, Thy God is on his feet.
the watchmen will raise the voice, and they will sing: They will see the Lord's return, and they will see the same eye.
sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted his people, he has saved Jerusalem.

who's the Lord's arm?
he's a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground, he's not beautiful.
he's hated and rejected by men, and he's known to be a sad, and he's known to be a little sad.
we were saddened, we were saddened, we were saddened, we were saddened, we were saddened.
he was wounded in our sins, but he was wounded in our sins, and we were healed.
we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has made us all guilty.
he was oppressed, and he was suffering, but he didn't open his mouth: He's a lamb to the slaughter, and he's a sheep before his eyes.
he's been taken from prison and from the court: Who's gonna tell the generation?
he was taken out of the land of the living: He was a transgression of my people.
he was a grave, and the rich man died with him, because he didn't do anything, and he didn't lie.
when you make him a sin, he will be happy to bruise him, and he will be happy to suffer, and the LORD will prosper in his soul.
he will see the suffering of his soul, and he will be satisfied: He will bear the sins of my soul.
he divided the spoils with the strong, and he divided the spoils with the strong, because he had poured his soul into death.

instead of the thorn, the fir tree, the myrtle tree, and the name of the Lord will be forever.

no one shall speak to the stranger, who joins himself to the Lord, saying, The Lord has completely separated me from my people.
I will give them a place and a place in my house and in my walls, and I will give them my house and my walls, and I will give them my house and my walls.

who's the sport you're playing against?
who's gonna pull your tongue out of your mouth?
you're not kids who have transgressed, you're kids who have lied, you're kids who have killed children in the valleys under the rocks?
your part is among the smooth stones of the stream, and they are your lot.
should I be comforted by this?
you lay down on a high mountain and offered a sacrifice.
you have also taken the door and the posts, and you have revealed yourself to someone else than me, and you have expanded your bed.
you took the ointment, and you increased your perfume, and you sent your messengers far away, and you were debased.
you were in the way of great power, yet you didn't say, There's no hope.
and who were you afraid or afraid to tell me, and you didn't remember me?
I've never been quiet, and you're not afraid of me?
I'll tell you, your righteousness and your deeds will not be profitable.
if you're afraid, let your companies go, but the wind will carry them away; vanity will be taken away, but he who trusts me will be able to take the land.

look, you're going to be fast, you're going to be quick, you're going to be quick, you're going to be quick, you're going to be quick.
so I chose it so quickly?
a day to be a man who hurts his soul?
to bow to the ground and spread the ashes under him?
shall the Lord be pleased with such a day?
I didn't choose the fastest?
to let the evil go, to undo the heavy burden, and to let the oppressed go free?
you don't want to feed the hungry, and you're going to the house of the poor?
when you see the naked, you see him, and you don't hide your body?
then the morning will break, and the light will be broken, and your health will be quick.

they know not peace, and they don't know who goes there, and they don't know who's going to be happy.
we wait for light, but we're in darkness.
we're like blind, and we're like blind, and we're like blind, and we're like blind, and we're like blind, and we're like blind.

the judge is turned away, and justice is not far away.
truth is, he's a fool, and he's a prey to the Lord, who saw him, and he was disgusted.
he saw no man, and he wondered if there was no one to help him:
he put on the breastplate of righteousness, and the helmet of salvation on his head; and he was dressed in the robes of vengeance.

the Kedar will come to you, the Nebaioth will be with you, and I will be honored by the house of my glory.

I have struck you, but I have mercy on you, and I have mercy on the sons of strangers.
so the gates of the gate are open, and the gates are open to the Gentiles, and the king's troops will be brought to you.
the nation and the kingdom that will not serve you will be utterly destroyed.
the glory of Lebanon will be yours, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box, and I'll make it beautiful.
they will bow to you, and all who despise you will bow to you; and they will call you, the city of the Lord, the Holy One.

all who see them will recognize them, that they are the seed of the Lord, and they will be known by the Gentiles.
for the Lord, my soul will be happy with the Lord, for he has taken me to the robe of salvation, and he has adorned me with the robe of righteousness.
the Lord God will bring forth the righteousness and praise of the nations, and the earth will bring forth the bud.
I will not rest until the righteousness of the Lord is revealed, and the salvation of Jerusalem is as bright as a light, and the salvation of the Lord is as bright as a flame.
