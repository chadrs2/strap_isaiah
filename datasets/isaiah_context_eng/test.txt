Verse 19, in simile, says thy seed  as the sand to indicate the multitude of descendants  that could be theirs if Israel hearkened to the Lord
as Caspari has well explained it, ‘He does not punish all the members of the nation with the same severity; and those whom He punishes with greater severity than others He does not punish incessantly, but as soon as His end is attained, and the husks of sin are separated from those that have been punished, the punishment ceases, and only the worst in the nation, who are nothing but husks, and the husks on the nation itself, are swept away by the punishments’
Isaiah also used geography figuratively, a technique which, if understood, adds great depth to his message
This manner of prophesying includes several elements
The Lord said, Great are the words of Isaiah
Lebanon and Bashan with their northern mountains and lofty cedars connoted pride and haughtiness
To one who knows the geography of the areas of which Isaiah spoke, his writings are much more clear and have greater impact
Isaiah began his book with a quotation from the song of Moses, which is contained in the law
The wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah similarly represented unrighteousness
The Book of Mormon prophets obtained this material from the brass plates, which were written before 600 B
They can be understood by those who sincerely desire to do so
By learning of what they have written, it is possible to see where Isaiah’s writings fit into the Lord’s overall plan
